### OBSERVE
All passwords and keys stored in plaintext in the source will not be the same for the actual WeatherStation, and if you wish to use this project for your own weather-station. I suggest you change keys and passwords aswell as mentioned in the , installing the software, section. 

This project is done for a linux server, but to make it work for windows or mac shouldn't be too much work.

### INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE
